      <h2>Steps to test an app without test cases</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="middle-container">
      <p>
        Recently We faced this challenge to test an app without any documents.
        There were no test cases, all the requirements are communicated via text conversations,
        engineers who worked on this app earlier are either left the organization or moved to different projects,
        and documents are not maintained properly. There are no substitute to a well documented Test Cases with elaborate steps.
        But these things are becoming a rarity with rapid development cycles and shift towards minimum or no documents.
      </p>
      <p>
        We followed below steps to test this application, hopefully this document helps you if you face similar challenges.

        <h3>Communicate to understand your role</h3>
        <p>When you start working the most important task is to communicate with the dev team or client to understand the business login and why you need to test this application, Some of the common reasons are listed below.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>New requirements</li>
          <li>Production Issues</li>
          <li>Change in technology</li>
          <li>Performance issues</li>
          <li>With the latest OS upgrade in a device, there can be some new issue introduced. etc…</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Exploratory Testing</h3>
        <p>Exploratory testing is an approach to software testing that is often described as simultaneous learning, test design, and execution. While performing exploratory testing you should try to navigate all the screens, links and perform ideal user experience. You can also research similar features in other apps/websites.</p>

        <h3>Go through Old Issues</h3>
        <p>Going through old issues is time consuming but it will help in understanding which modules are prone to bugs and we can prioritize our testing efforts accordingly. it also gives us an idea about what type and level of testing is performed earlier.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="contents">
        <h3>Brainstorming</h3>
        <p>Any possible actions that can be performed on a feature can be a valid test case. Like adding an email in invalid format should give an error message. We can also have brainstorming sessions with dev team.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="contents">
        <h3>Writing Test Cases</h3>
        <p>From the knowledge acquired from above steps it is possible to start writing test cases. Most of the test cases you will write are based on assumptions, it is not possible to ask acceptance criteria for each and every scenario but it will be helpful to keep developers and clients in loop.</p>
